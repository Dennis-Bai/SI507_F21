Several virtual machine applications in cloud computing are delay-sensitive. Therefore, we can exploit virtualization in order to run virtual machines which provide the lowest response time to the users. In prior work, these delays were deterministic and specified, whereas in the real cloud environment, there are generally stochastic. In fact, what seems to be necessary in such a problem is to use an appropriate learning method to observe and learn the cloud computing environment that has not been considered in previous work. Also, a modified algorithm is needed to assign multiple virtual machines to physical machines. This requirement is considered in our solution as well. So, we consider virtual machine assignment as an online optimization problem. In this problem, the network delays of assignments are not specified primarily, but they are measured using appropriate learning method. We formulate the optimization problem with a weighted bipartite matching graph in which the edges' weight between each pair of vertices demonstrates network delay of that assignment. Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit strategy is used to solve this minimum weighted matching problem. We will converge to the optimum matching using the best tradeoff between exploration and exploitation. Results show that regret converges effectively over time using combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit, and polynomially in the number of unknown variables. Also, this strategy just requires storage which grows linearly in the number of unknown variables.", "article_number": "8862268", "pdf_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8862268", "html_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8862268/", "abstract_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8862268/", "publication_title": "2019 International Conference on Machine Learning, Big Data, Cloud and Parallel Computing (COMITCon)", "conference_location": "Faridabad, India", "conference_dates": "14-16 Feb. 2019", "publication_number": 8851231, "is_number": 8862171, "publication_year": 2019, "publication_date": "14-16 Feb. 2019", "start_page": "40", "end_page": "46", "citing_paper_count": 3, "citing_patent_count": 0, "index_terms": {"ieee_terms": {"terms": ["Virtual machining", "Cloud computing", "Delays", "Task analysis", "Bipartite graph", "Optimization", "Learning systems"]}, "author_terms": {"terms": ["Virtual Machine Assignment", "Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit", "Online Learning", "Cloud Computing"]}}, "isbn_formats": {"isbns": [{"format": "Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN", "value": "978-1-7281-0212-2", "isbnType": "New-2005"}, {"format": "CD", "value": "978-1-7281-0209-2", "isbnType": "New-2005"}, {"format": "Electronic ISBN", "value": "978-1-7281-0211-5", "isbnType": "New-2005"}]}}, {"doi": "10.1109/ICOEI.2019.8862656", "title": "A Literature Study On Machine Learning Fusion With IOT", "publisher": "IEEE", "isbn": "978-1-5386-9440-4", "rank": 5, "authors": {"authors": [{"affiliation": "UIET, Maharshi Dayanand University, Rohtak, Haryana, India", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087042598", "id": 37087042598, "full_name": "Kirti Sharma", "author_order": 1}, {"affiliation": "UIET, Maharshi Dayanand University, Rohtak, Haryana, India", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087041484", "id": 37087041484, "full_name": "Rainu Nandal", "author_order": 2}]}, "access_type": "LOCKED", "content_type": "Conferences", "abstract": "In the present era of rapidly growing mature technologies and their inter-connection with hardware devices and software applications plays a vital role for the emergence of different sensor devices that are inter-connected through internet in order to establish interaction with the physical objects in the world.

This work extends our previous work (Chopade et al. IEEE HST 2018, LAK2019) [1], [2]. Explicitly, we are interested in how teamwork skills and team dynamics are demonstrated as verbal and nonverbal behaviors, and how these behaviors can be captured and analyzed via passive data collection. For this work we use a two-player cooperative CPS game, Crisis in Space (CIS) from LRNG (Previously GlassLab Inc). During the summer of 2018, we implemented this CIS game for interns as a group study. A total of 34 participants played the game and provided study and survey data. During the study, we collected participants' game play data, such as audio, video and eye tracking data streams. This research involves analyzing CIS multimodal game data, and developing skill models, and machine learning techniques for CPS skills measurement. In this paper, we present our ML framework for the analysis of audio data along with preliminary results from a pilot study. The analysis of audio data uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques, such as bag-of-words and sentence embedding. Our preliminary results show that various NLP features can be used to describe successful and unsuccessful CPS performances. The ML based framework supports the development of evidence centered design for teamwork skills-mapping and aims to help teams operate effectively in a complex situation.

Our first approach is based on supervised learning for which we demonstrate significant gains with deep learning algorithms, particularly by utilizing a 3D convolutional neural network and transfer learning. Motivated by the radiologists' interpretations of the scans, we then show how to incorporate task-dependent feature representations into a CAD system via a graph-regularized sparse multi-task learning framework.

As a result, some cases used in algorithm training may be mislabeled, adversely affecting the algorithm's performance.

Because current experimental structure determination methods carry a high price tag, computational predictions are highly desirable. Given a protein sequence, computational methods produce numerous 3D structures known as decoys. Selection of the best quality decoys is both challenging and essential as the end users can handle only a few ones. Therefore, scoring functions are central to decoy selection. They combine measurable features into a single number indicator of decoy quality. Unfortunately, current scoring functions do not consistently select the best decoys. Machine learning techniques offer great potential to improve decoy scoring. This paper presents two machine-learning based scoring functions to predict the quality of proteins structures, i.e., the similarity between the predicted structure and the experimental one without knowing the latter.

Methods: T wave was segmented from averaged Magnetocardiography (MCG) recordings and 164 features were subsequently extracted. These features were categorized into three groups: time domain features, frequency domain features, and information theory features. Next, we compared different machine learning classifiers including: k-nearest neighbor, decision tree, support vector machine (SVM), and XGBoost. To identify ischemia heart disease (IHD) case, we selected three classifiers with best performance and applied model ensemble to average results. All 164 features were used in this stage. To localize ischemia, we classified IHD group according to stenosis locations, including left anterior descending (LAD), left circumflex artery (LCX), and right coronary artery (RCA). For this task, we used XGBoost classifier and 18 time domain features. Results: For IHD detection, the SVM-XGBoost model achieved best results with accuracy = 94.03%, precision = 86.56%, recall = 97.78%, F-score = 92.79%, AUC = 0.98, and average precision = 0.98. For ischemia localization, XGBoost model achieved accuracy = 0.74, 0.68, and 0.65, for LAD, LCX, and RCA, respectively. Conclusion: we have developed an automatic IHD detection and localization system. We find that 1. T wave repolarization synchronicity is an important factor to distinguish IHD from normal subjects 2. Magnetic field pattern is associated with stenosis location. Significance: The proposed machine learning method provides the clinicians a fast and accurate diagnosis tool to interpret MCG data, boosting its acceptance into clinics. Furthermore, the magnetic pole characteristics revealed by the method shows to be related to ischemia location, presenting the opportunity to noninvasively locate ischemia.", "article_number": "8502863", "pdf_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8502863", "html_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8502863/", "abstract_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8502863/", "publication_title": "IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering", "publication_number": 10, "is_number": 8718429, "publication_year": 2019, "publication_date": "June 2019", "start_page": "1658", "end_page": "1667", "citing_paper_count": 5, "citing_patent_count": 0, "index_terms": {"ieee_terms": {"terms": ["Feature extraction", "Electrocardiography", "Support vector machines", "Time-domain analysis", "Machine learning", "Arteries", "Diseases"]}, "author_terms": {"terms": ["Biomagnetics", "boosting", "feature extraction", "ischemic heart disease detection and localization", "machine learning", "magnetocardiography", "support vector machines"]}}}, {"doi": "10.1109/ICOEI.2019.8862768", "title": "Location prediction on Twitter using machine learning Techniques", "publisher": "IEEE", "isbn": "978-1-5386-9440-4", "rank": 17, "authors": {"authors": [{"affiliation": "School of Computing, Sathyabama Institute of Science and Technology, Chennai, India", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085358710", "id": 37085358710, "full_name": "K Indira", "author_order": 1}, {"affiliation": "School of Computing, Sathyabama Institute of Science and Technology, Chennai, India", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085632307", "id": 37085632307, "full_name": "E Brumancia", "author_order": 2}, {"affiliation": "School of Computing, Sathyabama Institute of Science and Technology, Chennai, India", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38583688800", "id": 38583688800, "full_name": "P Siva Kumar", "author_order": 3}, {"affiliation": "School of Computing, Sathyabama Institute of Science and Technology, Chennai, India", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087039859", "id": 37087039859, "full_name": "Shyamala Pavan Teja Reddy", "author_order": 4}]}, "access_type": "LOCKED", "content_type": "Conferences", "abstract": "Location prediction of users from online social media brings considerable research these days.

This problem draws researchers' attention to introduce an automated banknote recognition system that can be divided into a vision-based system and sensor-based system. The main aim of this study is to have deeper analysis on the effect of region and orientation on the performance of Machine Learning and Deep Learning respectively using Malaysian Ringgit banknotes (RM 1, RM 5, RM 10, RM 20, RM 50 and RM 100). In this project, two experiments conducted on two types of banknote image: different region and orientation captured by using handphone camera in a controlled environment. Feature extraction of the RGB values called RB, RG, and GB from banknote image with different region were used to the machine learning classification algorithms such as k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and Decision Tree Classifier (DTC), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Bayesian Classifier (BC) for recognizing each class of banknote. Banknote image with different orientation was directly feed to AlexNet, a pre-trained model of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the most popular image processing structure of Deep Learning Neural Network. Ten-fold cross-validation was used to select the optimized kNN, DTC, SVM, and BC which was based on the smallest cross-validation loss. After that, the performance of kNN, DTC, SVM, BC and AlexNet model was presented in a confusion matrix. Both kNN and DTC achieved 99.7% accuracy but both SVM and BC perform better by succeeded to achieve 100% accuracy. It also can be concluded that AlexNet can only perform great in testing new data if only the data had previously been trained with similar orientation. Orientation does give effect to the performance of AlexNet model.", "article_number": "8837068", "pdf_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8837068", "html_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8837068/", "abstract_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8837068/", "publication_title": "2019 IEEE 10th Control and System Graduate Research Colloquium (ICSGRC)", "conference_location": "Shah Alam, Malaysia", "conference_dates": "2-3 Aug. 2019", "publication_number": 8826553, "is_number": 8837048, "publication_year": 2019, "publication_date": "2-3 Aug. 2019", "start_page": "5", "end_page": "8", "citing_paper_count": 1, "citing_patent_count": 0, "index_terms": {"ieee_terms": {"terms": ["Databases", "Deep learning", "Feature extraction", "Support vector machines", "Cameras", "Mathematical model"]}, "author_terms": {"terms": ["Banknote Recognition", "Region", "Orientation", "Machine Learning", "AlexNet"]}}, "isbn_formats": {"isbns": [{"format": "Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN", "value": "978-1-7281-0756-1", "isbnType": "New-2005"}, {"format": "CD", "value": "978-1-7281-0754-7", "isbnType": "New-2005"}, {"format": "Electronic ISBN", "value": "978-1-7281-0755-4", "isbnType": "New-2005"}]}}, {"doi": "10.1109/ICAML48257.2019.00038", "title": "Analysis of Learning Approaches for Machine Translation Systems", "publisher": "IEEE", "isbn": "978-1-7281-3909-8", "rank": 24, "authors": {"authors": [{"affiliation": "Siksha 'O' Anusandhan University, India", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087500191", "id": 37087500191, "full_name": "Subhashree Satpathy", "author_order": 1}, {"affiliation": "Siksha 'O' Anusandhan University, India", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087499014", "id": 37087499014, "full_name": "Smita Prava Mishra", "author_order": 2}, {"affiliation": "Siksha 'O' Anusandhan University, India", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087500257", "id": 37087500257, "full_name": "Ajit Kumar Nayak", "author_order": 3}]}, "access_type": "LOCKED", "content_type": "Conferences", "abstract": "Machine Translation(MT) is a part of Natural Language Processing(NLP).
