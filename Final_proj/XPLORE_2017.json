Analysts in the security operation center (SOC) investigate the alerts to decide if it is truly malicious or not. However, generally the number of alerts is overwhelming with majority of them being false positive and exceeding the SOC's capacity to handle all alerts. Because of this, potential malicious attacks and compromised hosts may be missed. Machine learning is a viable approach to reduce the false positive rate and improve the productivity of SOC analysts. In this paper, we develop a user-centric machine learning framework for the cyber security operation center in real enterprise environment. We discuss the typical data sources in SOC, their work flow, and how to leverage and process these data sets to build an effective machine learning system. The paper is targeted towards two groups of readers. The first group is data scientists or machine learning researchers who do not have cyber security domain knowledge but want to build machine learning systems for security operations center. The second group of audiences are those cyber security practitioners who have deep knowledge and expertise in cyber security, but do not have machine learning experiences and wish to build one by themselves.

Typically, it is costly and time consuming to build a classifier, because this requires collecting training data (e.g., through crowdsourcing), selecting a suitable machine learning algorithm (through extensive tests and using domain-specific knowledge), and optimizing the underlying hyperparameters (applying a good understanding of the classifier's structure). In addition, all this information is typically proprietary and should be protected. With the proposed black-box attack approach, an adversary can use deep learning to reliably infer the necessary information by using labels previously obtained from the classifier under attack, and build a functionally equivalent machine learning classifier without knowing the type, structure or underlying parameters of the original classifier. Results for a text classification application demonstrate that deep learning can infer Naive Bayes and SVM classifiers with high accuracy and steal their functionalities.

In particular, the use of Multi Layer Perceptrons, recently enhanced with deep learning capabilities, is proposed. Furthermore, its performance is compared with the most commonly used machine learning methods, such as Support Vector Machines, Gaussian Processes, Regression Trees, Ensemble Boosting and Linear Regression. The analysis of the day-ahead energy prediction demonstrates that different prediction methods present significantly different levels of accuracy in the case of a challenging dataset that comprises an interesting mix of consumers, wind and solar generation.

Manufacturing, installation, operation and maintenance are part of the machine's history and should be taken into account. The paper focuses on experimental procedures to develop a multi-criteria methodology to classify up to ten machine conditions. Using machine learning for signal processing techniques, any deviation from a normal steady state might be categorized as an abnormal behavior and, when demonstrated, a fault. To take advantage of machine learning algorithms, a significant amount of data is needed. To demonstrate the procedure the authors examined a synchronous machine. The authors recorded currents and voltages primarily, in stator and rotor winding, well as rotational speed and electromechanical torque. The collected signals were filtered and pre-processed, and to 5038 features were calculated and transformed into a tidy dataset. The sparse Linear Discriminant Analysis algorithm was used to extract the most important defined features. The results are shown in 3D scatter plots; in which each machine condition is represented. It is then possible to visualize the ability of the model to identify the most discriminant features. The same method can be used for the diagnostic of other types of machine conditions.", "article_number": "7993548", "pdf_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7993548", "html_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7993548/", "abstract_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7993548/", "publication_title": "2017 International Symposium on Electrical Machines (SME)", "conference_location": "Naleczow, Poland", "conference_dates": "18-21 June 2017", "publication_number": 7988676, "is_number": 7993527, "publication_year": 2017, "publication_date": "18-21 June 2017", "start_page": "1", "end_page": "6", "citing_paper_count": 5, "citing_patent_count": 0, "index_terms": {"ieee_terms": {"terms": ["Power harmonic filters", "Feature extraction", "Harmonic analysis", "Sensors", "Stator windings", "Rotors", "Synchronous machines"]}, "author_terms": {"terms": ["machine learning", "synchronous machine", "classification", "fault diagnosis"]}}, "isbn_formats": {"isbns": [{"format": "Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN", "value": "978-1-5386-0360-4", "isbnType": "New-2005"}, {"format": "Electronic ISBN", "value": "978-1-5386-0359-8", "isbnType": "New-2005"}]}}, {"doi": "10.1109/ICSESS.2017.8342870", "title": "Machine learning for predictive maintenance of industrial machines using IoT sensor data", "publisher": "IEEE", "isbn": "978-1-5386-0498-4", "issn": "2327-0594", "rank": 24, "authors": {"authors": [{"affiliation": "Department of Computer Engineering, Pune Institute of Computer Technology, Pune, India", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086368419", "id": 37086368419, "full_name": "Ameeth Kanawaday", "author_order": 1}, {"affiliation": "Department of Production Engineering and Industrial Management, College of Engineering, Pune, India", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086368755", "id": 37086368755, "full_name": "Aditya Sane", "author_order": 2}]}, "access_type": "LOCKED", "content_type": "Conferences", "abstract": "The industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is the use of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in manufacturing which harnesses the machine data generated by various sensors and applies various analytics on it to gain useful information.

This paper explores the use of AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) forecasting on the time series data collected from various sensors from a Slitting Machine, to predict the possible failures and quality defects, thus improving the overall manufacturing process. The use of Machine Learning thus proves a vital component in IIoT having use cases in quality management and quality control, lowering the cost of maintenance and improving the overall manufacturing process.", "article_number": "8342870", "pdf_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8342870", "html_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8342870/", "abstract_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8342870/", "publication_title": "2017 8th IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering and Service Science (ICSESS)", "conference_location": "Beijing, China", "conference_dates": "24-26 Nov. 2017", "publication_number": 8336674, "is_number": 8342844, "publication_year": 2017, "publication_date": "24-26 Nov. 2017", "start_page": "87", "end_page": "90", "citing_paper_count": 27, "citing_patent_count": 0, "index_terms": {"ieee_terms": {"terms": ["Predictive models", "Production", "Data models", "Machine learning", "Predictive maintenance", "Forecasting"]}, "author_terms": {"terms": ["Machine Learning", "ARIMA Forecasting", "Data Analysis", "Predictive maintenance & Productivity"]}}, "isbn_formats": {"isbns": [{"format": "Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN", "value": "978-1-5386-0498-4", "isbnType": "New-2005"}, {"format": "CD", "value": "978-1-5386-0496-0", "isbnType": "New-2005"}, {"format": "Electronic ISBN", "value": "978-1-5386-0497-7", "isbnType": "New-2005"}]}}, {"doi": "10.1109/SmartTechCon.2017.8358559", "title": "Class result prediction using machine learning", "publisher": "IEEE", "isbn": "978-1-5386-0570-7", "rank": 25, "authors": {"authors": [{"affiliation": "Dept. of ISE, BMSIT&M, Bangalore, India", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086379414", "id": 37086379414, "full_name": "S K Pushpa", "author_order": 1}, {"affiliation": "Dept. of ISE, BMSIT&M, Bangalore, India", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085394336", "id": 37085394336, "full_name": "T N Manjunath", "author_order": 2}, {"affiliation": "Dept. of ISE, BMSIT&M, Bangalore, India", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086379487", "id": 37086379487, "full_name": "T V Mrunal", "author_order": 3}, {"affiliation": "Dept. of ISE, BMSIT&M, Bangalore, India", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086379890", "id": 37086379890, "full_name": "Amartya Singh", "author_order": 4}, {"affiliation": "Dept. of ISE, BMSIT&M, Bangalore, India", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086379444", "id": 37086379444, "full_name": "C Suhas", "author_order": 5}]}, "access_type": "LOCKED", "content_type": "Conferences", "abstract": "More than 2.5 quintillion bytes of data is being generated across the globe.
