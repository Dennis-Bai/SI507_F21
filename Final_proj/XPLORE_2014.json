The MK-SVM method leverages a linear combination of single kernels to achieve accurate faulty-component classification based on the errors observed. The MK-SVMs thus generated can also be updated based on incremental learning, which allows the diagnosis system to quickly adapt to new error observations and provide even more accurate fault diagnosis.

In these cases, the error distribution deviates from uniformity due to the heteroscedastic nature of the underlying experimental set-up. This problem of systematic and structured (non-uniform) label noise is ignored when analysis are based on behavioral data, as is being done typically. Thus, we run the risk to arrive at wrong conclusions in our analysis.

To date, machine learning research has not considered the impacts of these properties on the machine learning prediction task in educational settings. Machine learning algorithms may have applications in supporting targeted intervention approaches. The goals of this paper are to: 1) determine the impact of process-level information on machine learning prediction results and 2) establish the effect of type of machine learning algorithm used on prediction results. Data were collected from a university level course in human factors engineering (n=35), which included both traditional classroom assessment and computer-based assessment methods. A set of common regression and classification algorithms were applied to the data to predict final course score. The overall prediction accuracy as well as the chronological progression of prediction accuracy was analyzed for each algorithm. Simple machine learning algorithms (linear regression, logistic regression) had comparable performance with more complex methods (support vector machines, artificial neural networks). Process-level information was not useful in post-hoc predictions, but contributed significantly to allowing for accurate predictions to be made earlier in the course. Process level information provides useful prediction features for development of targeted intervention techniques, as it allows more accurate predictions to be made earlier in the course. For small course data sets, the prediction accuracy and simplicity of linear regression and logistic regression make these methods preferable to more complex algorithms.", "article_number": "6730683", "pdf_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6730683", "html_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6730683/", "abstract_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6730683/", "publication_title": "IEEE Access", "publication_number": 6287639, "is_number": 6705689, "publication_year": 2014, "publication_date": "2014", "start_page": "78", "end_page": "87", "citing_paper_count": 19, "citing_patent_count": 0, "index_terms": {"ieee_terms": {"terms": ["Measurement", "Predictive models", "Machine learning algorithms", "Linear regression", "Artificial neural networks", "Prediction algorithms", "Machine learning"]}, "author_terms": {"terms": ["Machine learning", "training", "decision support systems", "educational technology", "statistical learning"]}}}, {"doi": "10.1109/ICITEC.2014.7105611", "title": "Learning high-level features by deep Boltzmann machines for handwriting digits recogintion", "publisher": "IEEE", "isbn": "978-1-4799-5298-4", "rank": 10, "authors": {"authors": [{"affiliation": "CIMS Research Center, Tongji University, Shanghai, China", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085446476", "id": 37085446476, "full_name": "Shuo Zhang", "author_order": 1}, {"affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, Hohai University, Nanjing, China", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085429704", "id": 37085429704, "full_name": "Wuyi Zhang", "author_order": 2}, {"affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085426218", "id": 37085426218, "full_name": "Kary Kang", "author_order": 3}]}, "access_type": "LOCKED", "content_type": "Conferences", "abstract": "Handwriting recognition is the ability of a computer to understand handwritten inputs from users.

In the hidden layer (feature mapping), nodes are randomly generated independently of training data. Furthermore, a unified ELM was proposed, providing a single framework to simplify and unify different learning methods, such as SLFNs, least square support vector machines, proximal support vector machines, and so on. However, the solution of unified ELM is dense, and thus, usually plenty of storage space and testing time are required for large-scale applications. In this paper, a sparse ELM is proposed as an alternative solution for classification, reducing storage space and testing time. In addition, unified ELM obtains the solution by matrix inversion, whose computational complexity is between quadratic and cubic with respect to the training size. It still requires plenty of training time for large-scale problems, even though it is much faster than many other traditional methods. In this paper, an efficient training algorithm is specifically developed for sparse ELM. The quadratic programming problem involved in sparse ELM is divided into a series of smallest possible sub-problems, each of which are solved analytically. Compared with SVM, sparse ELM obtains better generalization performance with much faster training speed. Compared with unified ELM, sparse ELM achieves similar generalization performance for binary classification applications, and when dealing with large-scale binary classification problems, sparse ELM realizes even faster training speed than unified ELM.", "article_number": "6756997", "pdf_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6756997", "html_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6756997/", "abstract_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6756997/", "publication_title": "IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics", "publication_number": 6221036, "is_number": 6898047, "publication_year": 2014, "publication_date": "Oct. 2014", "start_page": "1858", "end_page": "1870", "citing_paper_count": 166, "citing_patent_count": 0, "index_terms": {"ieee_terms": {"terms": ["Support vector machines", "Kernel", "Training", "Testing", "Sparse matrices", "Training data", "Optimization"]}, "author_terms": {"terms": ["Classification", "extreme learning machine (ELM)", "quadratic programming (QP)", "sequential minimal optimization (SMO)", "sparse ELM", "support vector machine (SVM)", "unified ELM", "Classification", "extreme learning machine (ELM)", "quadratic programming (QP)", "sequential minimal optimization (SMO)", "sparse ELM", "support vector machine (SVM)", "unified ELM"]}}}, {"doi": "10.1109/TELFOR.2014.7034563", "title": "Performance comparison of Machine Learning Algorithms for diagnosis of Cardiotocograms with class inequality", "publisher": "IEEE", "isbn": "978-1-4799-6190-0", "rank": 20, "authors": {"authors": [{"affiliation": "Department of Informatics & Telecommunications, University of Athens, Campus, Ilisia, 15784, Greece", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085511559", "id": 37085511559, "full_name": "Ioannis Chr.

The MRELM can simultaneously consider the geometrical structure and discriminative information in EEG data. Using differential entropy features across whole five frequency bands, the average accuracy of MRELM is 81.01%, which is better than those obtained by GELM (80.25%) and SVM (76.62%). The accuracies obtained from high frequency band features (\u03b2, \u03b3) are obviously superior to those of low frequency band features, which shows \u03b2 and \u03b3 bands are more relevant to emotional states transition.
