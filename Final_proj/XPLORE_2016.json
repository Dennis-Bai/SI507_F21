A prototype system is implemented and the experiments on practical air quality data in Beijing validate the effectiveness of our method and system.", "article_number": "7838275", "pdf_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7838275", "html_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7838275/", "abstract_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7838275/", "publication_title": "2016 15th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA)", "conference_location": "Anaheim, CA, USA", "conference_dates": "18-20 Dec. 2016", "publication_number": 7835817, "is_number": 7838104, "publication_year": 2016, "publication_date": "18-20 Dec. 2016", "start_page": "950", "end_page": "953", "citing_paper_count": 6, "citing_patent_count": 0, "index_terms": {"ieee_terms": {"terms": ["Air quality", "Predictive models", "Atmospheric modeling", "Training", "Data models", "Wind forecasting", "Monitoring"]}, "author_terms": {"terms": ["PM2.5 concentration", "prediction", "extreme learning machine"]}}, "isbn_formats": {"isbns": [{"format": "Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN", "value": "978-1-5090-6168-6", "isbnType": "New-2005"}, {"format": "Electronic ISBN", "value": "978-1-5090-6167-9", "isbnType": "New-2005"}]}}, {"doi": "10.1109/TMI.2016.2526687", "title": "Combining Generative and Discriminative Representation Learning for Lung CT Analysis With Convolutional Restricted Boltzmann Machines", "publisher": "IEEE", "issue": "5", "issn": "1558-254X", "rank": 16, "volume": "35", "authors": {"authors": [{"affiliation": "Biomedical Imaging Group, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085820477", "id": 37085820477, "full_name": "Gijs van Tulder", "author_order": 1}, {"affiliation": "Biomedical Imaging Group, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37271843900", "id": 37271843900, "full_name": "Marleen de Bruijne", "author_order": 2}]}, "access_type": "LOCKED", "content_type": "Journals", "abstract": "The choice of features greatly influences the performance of a tissue classification system. Despite this, many systems are built with standard, predefined filter banks that are not optimized for that particular application. Representation learning methods such as restricted Boltzmann machines may outperform these standard filter banks because they learn a feature description directly from the training data. Like many other representation learning methods, restricted Boltzmann machines are unsupervised and are trained with a generative learning objective; this allows them to learn representations from unlabeled data, but does not necessarily produce features that are optimal for classification. In this paper we propose the convolutional classification restricted Boltzmann machine, which combines a generative and a discriminative learning objective. This allows it to learn filters that are good both for describing the training data and for classification. We present experiments with feature learning for lung texture classification and airway detection in CT images. In both applications, a combination of learning objectives outperformed purely discriminative or generative learning, increasing, for instance, the lung tissue classification accuracy by 1 to 8 percentage points. This shows that discriminative learning can help an otherwise unsupervised feature learner to learn filters that are optimized for classification.", "article_number": "7401039", "pdf_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7401039", "html_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7401039/", "abstract_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7401039/", "publication_title": "IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging", "publication_number": 42, "is_number": 7463083, "publication_year": 2016, "publication_date": "May 2016", "start_page": "1262", "end_page": "1272", "citing_paper_count": 84, "citing_patent_count": 7, "index_terms": {"ieee_terms": {"terms": ["Lungs", "Standards", "Feature extraction", "Computed tomography", "Neural networks", "Learning systems", "Training data"]}, "author_terms": {"terms": ["Deep learning", "lung", "machine learning", "neural network", "pattern recognition and classification", "representation learning", "restricted Boltzmann machine", "segmentation", "X-ray imaging and computed tomography"]}}}, {"doi": "10.1109/RAMS.2016.7448033", "title": "Predicting hardware failure using machine learning", "publisher": "IEEE", "isbn": "978-1-5090-0248-1", "rank": 17, "authors": {"authors": [{"affiliation": "Google[x]", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085768953", "id": 37085768953, "full_name": "Asha Chigurupati", "author_order": 1}, {"affiliation": "Google[x]", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085768025", "id": 37085768025, "full_name": "Romain Thibaux", "author_order": 2}, {"affiliation": "Google[x]", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38235069500", "id": 38235069500, "full_name": "Noah Lassar", "author_order": 3}]}, "access_type": "LOCKED", "content_type": "Conferences", "abstract": "The Weibull distribution has historically been the Reliability Engineer's best tool for describing the probability of failures over time [1]. While this technique is very accurate at describing failure distributions for large populations of components, it works very poorly at predicting the time until failure of an individual component. The mean time until failure is often used to predict times until failure of individual components, but this value may vary greatly with actual times until failure. With the advent of machine learning techniques, the ability to learn from past behavior in order to predict future behavior makes it possible to predict an individual component's time until failure much more accurately. In this paper, we explore the predictive abilities of a machine learning technique to improve upon our ability to predict individual component times until failure in advance of actual failure. Once failure is predicted, an impending problem can be fixed before it actually occurs. This paper brings to light a machine learning approach for predicting individual component times until failure that we will show is far more accurate than the traditional MTBF approach. The algorithm built was able to monitor the health of 14 hardware samples and notify us of an impending failure well ahead of actual failure, providing adequate time to fix the problem before actual failure occurred.", "article_number": "7448033", "pdf_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7448033", "html_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7448033/", "abstract_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7448033/", "publication_title": "2016 Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium (RAMS)", "conference_location": "Tucson, AZ, USA", "conference_dates": "25-28 Jan. 2016", "publication_number": 7442973, "is_number": 7447953, "publication_year": 2016, "publication_date": "25-28 Jan. 2016", "start_page": "1", "end_page": "6", "citing_paper_count": 13, "citing_patent_count": 0, "index_terms": {"ieee_terms": {"terms": ["Training", "Machine learning algorithms", "Support vector machines", "Prediction algorithms", "Classification algorithms", "Hardware", "Data models"]}, "author_terms": {"terms": ["Failure Prediction", "Machine Learning", "Data Loss"]}}, "isbn_formats": {"isbns": [{"format": "CD", "value": "978-1-5090-0248-1", "isbnType": "New-2005"}, {"format": "Electronic ISBN", "value": "978-1-5090-0249-8", "isbnType": "New-2005"}]}}, {"doi": "10.1109/CCECE.2016.7726783", "title": "Machine learning for quality prediction in abrasion-resistant material manufacturing process", "publisher": "IEEE", "isbn": "978-1-4673-8722-4", "rank": 18, "authors": {"authors": [{"affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085891331", "id": 37085891331, "full_name": "Parsa Mohammadi", "author_order": 1}, {"affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37335978400", "id": 37335978400, "full_name": "Z.

While data-driven methods demonstrate promising detection performance, a particular challenge is how to reduce the considerable cost for collecting labeled data. This paper explored semi-supervised methods for driver distraction detection in real driving conditions to alleviate the cost of labeling training data. Laplacian support vector machine and semi-supervised extreme learning machine were evaluated using eye and head movements to classify two driver states: attentive and cognitively distracted. With the additional unlabeled data, the semi-supervised learning methods improved the detection performance (G-mean) by 0.0245, on average, over all subjects, as compared with the traditional supervised methods. As unlabeled training data can be collected from drivers' naturalistic driving records with little extra resource, semi-supervised methods, which utilize both labeled and unlabeled data, can enhance the efficiency of model development in terms of time and cost.", "article_number": "7347425", "pdf_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347425", "html_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347425/", "abstract_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347425/", "publication_title": "IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems", "publication_number": 6979, "is_number": 7442200, "publication_year": 2016, "publication_date": "April 2016", "start_page": "1108", "end_page": "1120", "citing_paper_count": 86, "citing_patent_count": 1, "index_terms": {"ieee_terms": {"terms": ["Vehicles", "Training data", "Semisupervised learning", "Labeling", "Real-time systems", "Position measurement", "Support vector machines"]}, "author_terms": {"terms": ["Advanced driver assistance system", "driver distraction", "eye movement", "machine learning", "semi-supervised learning", "Advanced driver assistance system", "driver distraction", "eye movement", "machine learning", "semi-supervised learning"]}}}, {"doi": "10.1109/MITICON.2016.8025242", "title": "Predictive analytics for chronic kidney disease using machine learning techniques", "publisher": "IEEE", "isbn": "978-1-5090-4106-0", "rank": 25, "authors": {"authors": [{"affiliation": "Department of Information Technology, Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Rambhai Barni Rajabhat University, Thailand", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085647225", "id": 37085647225, "full_name": "Anusorn Charleonnan", "author_order": 1}, {"affiliation": "Department of Information Technology, Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Rambhai Barni Rajabhat University, Thailand", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086017822", "id": 37086017822, "full_name": "Thipwan Fufaung", "author_order": 2}, {"affiliation": "Department of Information Technology, Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Rambhai Barni Rajabhat University, Thailand", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086017586", "id": 37086017586, "full_name": "Tippawan Niyomwong", "author_order": 3}, {"affiliation": "Department of Information Technology, Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Rambhai Barni Rajabhat University, Thailand", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086017773", "id": 37086017773, "full_name": "Wandee Chokchueypattanakit", "author_order": 4}, {"affiliation": "Department of Information Technology, Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Rambhai Barni Rajabhat University, Thailand", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086020936", "id": 37086020936, "full_name": "Sathit Suwannawach", "author_order": 5}, {"affiliation": "Department of Information Technology, Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Rambhai Barni Rajabhat University, Thailand", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086024640", "id": 37086024640, "full_name": "Nitat Ninchawee", "author_order": 6}]}, "access_type": "LOCKED", "content_type": "Conferences", "abstract": "Predictive analytics for healthcare using machine learning is a challenged task to help doctors decide the exact treatments for saving lives.
