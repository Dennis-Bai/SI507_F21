Many of these approaches depended on a qualitative analysis and lacked any quantitative analysis. Therefore, this work is focused on bridging the gap between qualitative and quantitative approaches to classify student attentiveness. Thus, this research applies machine learning algorithms (K-means and SVM) to automatically classify students as attentive or inattentive using data from a consumer RGB-D sensor. Results of this research can be used to improve teaching strategies for instructors at all levels and can aid instructors in implementing personalized learning systems, which is a National Academy of Engineering Grand Challenge. This research applies machine learning algorithms to an educational setting. Data from these algorithms can be used by instructors to provide valuable feedback on the effectiveness of their instructional strategies and pedagogies. Instructors can use this feedback to improve their instructional strategies, and students will benefit by achieving improved learning and subject mastery. Ultimately, this will result in the students' increased ability to do work in their respective areas. Broadly, this work can help advance efforts in many areas of education and instruction.

In this paper, a novel framework of ACDs with sparse kernel machines is presented by integrating kernel methods into the critic of ACDs. To improve the generalization capability as well as the computational efficiency of kernel machines, a sparsification method based on the approximately linear dependence analysis is used. Using the sparse kernel machines, two kernel-based ACD algorithms, that is, kernel HDP (KHDP) and kernel DHP (KDHP), are proposed and their performance is analyzed both theoretically and empirically. Because of the representation learning and generalization capability of sparse kernel machines, KHDP and KDHP can obtain much better performance than previous HDP and DHP with manually designed neural networks.

The overall architecture of our SCADA scenario, which utilise proposed knowledge generation is based on a multi-agent approach. This design is different from what we can see in conventional commercial SCADA solutions. Nowadays, there is a big pressure on operators to precisely analyse a huge amount of data coming from technological processes and make right decisions in the right time. This is where a real-time knowledge generation can highly improve decision making strategies in complex industrial processes. Nevertheless, the actual state of the art solutions are usually not using the knowledge generation directly, or there are often restricted so called off-line learning approaches. The recent development in the area of machine learning lead to the creation of distributed solutions which could process real-time data and dynamically adapt the generated knowledge. We applied this on-line machine learning approach in our proposed prototype. The experimental agent is focused on the specific scenario of the process alarm forecasting, which is considered to be a binary classification problem. We describe our solution for useful classifier feature vector construction. The classifier itself is based on Passive-Aggressive algorithm.

Moreover, ML can and occasionally does use ASR as a large-scale, realistic application to rigorously test the effectiveness of a given technique, and to inspire new problems arising from the inherently sequential and dynamic nature of speech. On the other hand, even though ASR is available commercially for some applications, it is largely an unsolved problem - for almost all applications, the performance of ASR is not on par with human performance. New insight from modern ML methodology shows great promise to advance the state-of-the-art in ASR technology. This overview article provides readers with an overview of modern ML techniques as utilized in the current and as relevant to future ASR research and systems. The intent is to foster further cross-pollination between the ML and ASR communities than has occurred in the past. The article is organized according to the major ML paradigms that are either popular already or have potential for making significant contributions to ASR technology. The paradigms presented and elaborated in this overview include: generative and discriminative learning; supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and active learning; adaptive and multi-task learning; and Bayesian learning. These learning paradigms are motivated and discussed in the context of ASR technology and applications.
