Most current transfer-learning methods focus on scenarios where the auxiliary and the target learning tasks are very similar: either (some of) the auxiliary data can be directly used as training examples for the target task or the auxiliary and the target data share the same representation. However, in many cases the connection between the auxiliary and the target tasks can be remote. Only a few features derived from the auxiliary data may be helpful for the target learning. We call such scenario the deep transfer-learning scenario and we introduce a novel transfer-learning method for deep transfer. Our method uses restricted Boltzmann machine to discover a set of hierarchical features from the auxiliary data. We then select from these features a subset that are helpful for the target learning, using a selection criterion based on the concept of kernel-target alignment. Finally, the target data are augmented with the selected features before training. Our experiment results show that this transfer method is effective. It can improve classification accuracy by up to more than 10%, even when the connection between the auxiliary and the target tasks is not apparent.", "article_number": "6146992", "pdf_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6146992", "html_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6146992/", "abstract_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6146992/", "publication_title": "2011 10th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications and Workshops", "conference_location": "Honolulu, HI, USA", "conference_dates": "18-21 Dec. 2011", "publication_number": 6146696, "is_number": 6146931, "publication_year": 2011, "publication_date": "18-21 Dec. 2011", "start_page": "323", "end_page": "326", "citing_paper_count": 10, "citing_patent_count": 0, "index_terms": {"ieee_terms": {"terms": ["Training", "Machine learning", "Vectors", "Accuracy", "Kernel", "Data models", "Random variables"]}, "author_terms": {"terms": ["transfer learning", "restricted Boltzmann machine", "document classification"]}}, "isbn_formats": {"isbns": [{"format": "CD", "value": "978-0-7695-4607-0", "isbnType": "New-2005"}, {"format": "Print ISBN", "value": "978-1-4577-2134-2", "isbnType": "New-2005"}]}}, {"doi": "10.1109/ICMLA.2011.49", "title": "Comparison of Classification Techniques used in Machine Learning as Applied on Vocational Guidance Data", "publisher": "IEEE", "isbn": "978-0-7695-4607-0", "partnum": "11PR4607", "rank": 2, "volume": "2", "authors": {"authors": [{"affiliation": "Dept. of Comput.

The sharp onsets and offsets of light are known to induce a steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) at low frequencies. However, it is not well-known how the brain processes visual flicker at the threshold of conscious perception and beyond. To shed more light on this, we ran an EEG study in which we asked participants (N=6) to discriminate on a behavioral level between visual stimuli in which they perceived flicker and those that they perceived as constant wave light. We found that high frequency flicker which is not perceived consciously anymore still elicits a neural response in the corresponding frequency band of EEG, con-tralateral to the stimulated hemifield. The main contribution of this paper is to show the benefit of machine learning techniques for investigating this effect of subconscious processing: Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) filtering in combination with classification based on Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) could be used to reveal the effect for additional participants and stimuli, with high statistical significance. We conclude that machine learning techniques are a valuable extension of conventional neurophysiological analysis that can substantially boost the sensitivity to subconscious effects, such as the processing of imperceptible flicker.", "article_number": "6090625", "pdf_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6090625", "html_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6090625/", "abstract_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6090625/", "publication_title": "2011 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "conference_location": "Boston, MA, USA", "conference_dates": "30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2011", "publication_number": 6067544, "is_number": 6089866, "publication_year": 2011, "publication_date": "30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2011", "start_page": "3692", "end_page": "3695", "citing_paper_count": 6, "citing_patent_count": 0, "index_terms": {"ieee_terms": {"terms": ["Electroencephalography", "Machine learning", "Visualization", "Light sources", "Humans", "Light emitting diodes", "Training"]}}, "isbn_formats": {"isbns": [{"format": "Online ISBN", "value": "978-1-4244-4122-8", "isbnType": "New-2005"}, {"format": "Print ISBN", "value": "978-1-4244-4121-1", "isbnType": "New-2005"}, {"format": "Electronic ISBN", "value": "978-1-4577-1589-1", "isbnType": "New-2005"}]}}, {"doi": "10.1109/CSO.2011.302", "title": "Single-Machine Scheduling Problems with Decreasing Linear Deterioration and Learning Effects", "publisher": "IEEE", "isbn": "978-0-7695-4335-2", "partnum": "11PR4335", "rank": 17, "authors": {"authors": [{"affiliation": "Dept. of Math., Honghe Univ., Mengzi, China", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37717081700", "id": 37717081700, "full_name": "Xiaokun Huang", "author_order": 1}, {"affiliation": "Sch. of Math. & Inf.

The L-GEM upper bound (R*<sub>SM</sub>) is computed for each output neuron of a Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN).

How to use these K L-GEM values to select the architecture of a RBFNN is still an open problem. One could use average, maximum and minimum value among these K L-GEM values to estimate the overall performance of the RBFNN under investigation. All three of them are reasonable and provide some information about the generalization capability of the RBFNN.

Promising results are reported, also compared to the state-of-the-art, at lower computational complexity.", "article_number": "6064625", "pdf_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064625", "html_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064625/", "abstract_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064625/", "publication_title": "2011 IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing", "conference_location": "Beijing, China", "conference_dates": "18-21 Sept. 2011", "publication_number": 6058570, "is_number": 6064496, "publication_year": 2011, "publication_date": "18-21 Sept. 2011", "start_page": "1", "end_page": "6", "citing_paper_count": 1, "citing_patent_count": 0, "index_terms": {"ieee_terms": {"terms": ["Support vector machines", "Optimization", "Training", "Prototypes", "Kernel", "Joints", "Machine learning"]}, "author_terms": {"terms": ["\u00b5-SVM", "scatter", "multi-class"]}}, "isbn_formats": {"isbns": [{"format": "Online ISBN", "value": "978-1-4577-1622-5", "isbnType": "New-2005"}, {"format": "Print ISBN", "value": "978-1-4577-1621-8", "isbnType": "New-2005"}, {"format": "Electronic ISBN", "value": "978-1-4577-1623-2", "isbnType": "New-2005"}]}}, {"doi": "10.1109/MLSP.2011.6064601", "title": "Learning distances to improve phoneme classification", "publisher": "IEEE", "isbn": "978-1-4577-1622-5", "issn": "1551-2541", "partnum": "11TH9241", "rank": 25, "authors": {"authors": [{"affiliation": "Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 777 Atlantic Drive, Atlanta, 30332-0250, USA", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38031011700", "id": 38031011700, "full_name": "Ryan Curtin", "author_order": 1}, {"affiliation": "Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 777 Atlantic Drive, Atlanta, 30332-0250, USA", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283490300", "id": 37283490300, "full_name": "Nikolaos Vasiloglou", "author_order": 2}, {"affiliation": "Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 777 Atlantic Drive, Atlanta, 30332-0250, USA", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37278895600", "id": 37278895600, "full_name": "David V.

To learn and to evaluate the performance of our distance, we use the simple k-nearest-neighbors (k-NN) classifier. Although this classifier exhibits low performance relative to state-of-the-art phoneme classifiers, it can be used to determine a distance metric that is applicable to many other better-performing machine learning methods. We devise a novel optimization method that minimizes the error function of the k-NN classifier with respect to the covariance matrix of the Mahalanobis distance, based on finite-difference stochastic approximation (FDSA) gradient estimates combined with a random perturbation term to avoid local minima. We apply our method to the problem of phoneme classification with the k-NN classifier and show that our learned distance provides performance improvement of up to 8:19% over the standard k-NN classifier, and additionally outperforms other state-of-the-art distance learning methods by approximately 4 percentage points. We also find that the computational complexity of our method, while not optimal, is better than other distance learning methods. The performance improvements for individual phoneme classes are given. The distances learned are applicable to other scale-variant machine learning methods, such as support vector machines, multidimensional scaling, and maximum variance unfolding, as well as others.", "article_number": "6064601", "pdf_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064601", "html_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064601/", "abstract_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064601/", "publication_title": "2011 IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing", "conference_location": "Beijing, China", "conference_dates": "18-21 Sept. 2011", "publication_number": 6058570, "is_number": 6064496, "publication_year": 2011, "publication_date": "18-21 Sept. 2011", "start_page": "1", "end_page": "6", "citing_paper_count": 0, "citing_patent_count": 0, "index_terms": {"ieee_terms": {"terms": ["Computer aided instruction", "Accuracy", "Measurement", "Machine learning", "Optimization", "Learning systems", "Mel frequency cepstral coefficient"]}, "author_terms": {"terms": ["distance learning", "Mahalanobis distance", "phoneme classification", "k-nearest-neighbors"]}}, "isbn_formats": {"isbns": [{"format": "Online ISBN", "value": "978-1-4577-1622-5", "isbnType": "New-2005"}, {"format": "Print ISBN", "value": "978-1-4577-1621-8", "isbnType": "New-2005"}, {"format": "Electronic ISBN", "value": "978-1-4577-1623-2", "isbnType": "New-2005"}]}}]}
