Sample sets of Lie group matrices are widely available in practical applications. Lie group learning is a vibrant field of increasing importance and extraordinary potential and thus needs to be developed further. This study aims to provide a comprehensive survey on recent advances in Lie group machine learning. We introduce Lie group machine learning techniques in three major categories: supervised Lie group machine learning, semisupervised Lie group machine learning, and unsupervised Lie group machine learning. In addition, we introduce the special application of Lie group machine learning in image processing. This work covers the following techniques: Lie group machine learning model, Lie group subspace orbit generation learning, symplectic group learning, quantum group learning, Lie group fiber bundle learning, Lie group cover learning, Lie group deep structure learning, Lie group semisupervised learning, Lie group kernel learning, tensor learning, frame bundle connection learning, spectral estimation learning, Finsler geometric learning, homology boundary learning, category representation learning, and neuromorphic synergy learning. Overall, this survey aims to provide an insightful overview of state-of-the-art development in the field of Lie group machine learning.

Traffic Environment involves everything that can affect the traffic flowing on the road, whether it's traffic signals, accidents, rallies, even repairing of roads that can cause a jam. If we have prior information which is very near approximate about all the above and many more daily life situations which can affect traffic then, a driver or rider can make an informed decision. Also, it helps in the future of autonomous vehicles. In the current decades, traffic data have been generating exponentially, and we have moved towards the big data concepts for transportation. Available prediction methods for traffic flow use some traffic prediction models and are still unsatisfactory to handle real-world applications. This fact inspired us to work on the traffic flow forecast problem build on the traffic data and models.It is cumbersome to forecast the traffic flow accurately because the data available for the transportation system is insanely huge. In this work, we planned to use machine learning, genetic, soft computing, and deep learning algorithms to analyse the big-data for the transportation system with much-reduced complexity.

Traditional firewalls rely on network administrators to set security rules for them, and network administrators sometimes need to choose to allow and deny packets to keep computer networks secure.

Since the early symptoms of diabetes are not obvious and the relationship between symptoms and diabetes is complex, the self-diagnosis results based on patients' own experience are not accurate. The process of Machine Learning is to train a computational algorithm for prediction based on a big dataset. It is popular for its efficiency and accuracy. Also, it has the advantage of dealing with tons of data, so we can make diagnoses for plenty of patients in a short time and the result will be more accurate.

Our data was from UCI Machine Learning Repository, which was collected by direct questionnaires from the patients of the Sylhet Diabetes Hospital in Sylhet, Bangladesh and approved by a doctor.

This model processes through the following steps: (i) Hard-copies of the case files with pronounced judgments related to dowry are collected from trial courts of West Bengal. (ii) Data set are generated manually based on certain parameters like:(a) `Victim Name' (b) `Number of years married (greater than seven years or not)'. In India, these parameters determine the key factors of `Dowry' related cases. If the case is filed within seven years of marriage and the defendant has taken dowry then the case falls under `dowry case' else not (c) `Dowry taken within seven years of marriage (Yes/No)' (d) `Incident occurred within seven years of marriage', this parameter shows that if the death has taken place within seven years of marriage it falls under 'Dowry Death' case. (e) `Postmortem Report (Usual/Unusual Death)' and many other documented parameters. (iii) A Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm namely, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to assist legal judgement through a prediction system. The objective of this paper is to predict whether a person is guilty or not, using a supervised learning approach. The paper shows the performance and accuracy of the model with a standard classifier i.e. Support Vector Machine (SVM).", "article_number": "9215310", "pdf_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9215310", "html_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9215310/", "abstract_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9215310/", "publication_title": "2020 International Conference on Smart Electronics and Communication (ICOSEC)", "conference_location": "Trichy, India", "conference_dates": "10-12 Sept. 2020", "publication_number": 9210168, "is_number": 9215228, "publication_year": 2020, "publication_date": "10-12 Sept. 2020", "start_page": "487", "end_page": "490", "citing_paper_count": 0, "citing_patent_count": 0, "index_terms": {"ieee_terms": {"terms": ["Support vector machines", "Law", "Feature extraction", "Machine learning", "Machine learning algorithms"]}, "author_terms": {"terms": ["Machine Learning", "Prediction System", "Legal Dataset", "Support Vector Machine (SVM)"]}}, "isbn_formats": {"isbns": [{"format": "Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN", "value": "978-1-7281-5462-6", "isbnType": "New-2005"}, {"format": "DVD ISBN", "value": "978-1-7281-5460-2", "isbnType": "New-2005"}, {"format": "Electronic ISBN", "value": "978-1-7281-5461-9", "isbnType": "New-2005"}]}}, {"doi": "10.1109/TALE48869.2020.9368373", "title": "Developing a Virtual Smart Total Learning Environment for Future Teaching-Learning System", "publisher": "IEEE", "isbn": "978-1-7281-6943-9", "issn": "2374-0191", "rank": 19, "authors": {"authors": [{"affiliation": "A\u2019Sharqiyah University,Sultanate,Oman", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086115984", "id": 37086115984, "full_name": "Mohammad Ali Akour", "author_order": 1}, {"affiliation": "Cotton University,India", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088801700", "id": 37088801700, "full_name": "Anupam Das", "author_order": 2}]}, "access_type": "LOCKED", "content_type": "Conferences", "abstract": "The world of education system after this COVID19 pandemic will have to change its dimension to map the needs of learners.
