Gene expressions captured in these images have been manually annotated with anatomical and developmental ontology terms using a controlled vocabulary (CV), which are useful in research aimed at understanding gene functions, interactions, and networks. With the rapid accumulation of images, the process of manual annotation has become increasingly cumbersome, and computational methods to automate this task are urgently needed. However, the automated annotation of embryo images is challenging. This is because the annotation terms spatially correspond to local expression patterns of images, yet they are assigned collectively to groups of images and it is unknown which term corresponds to which region of which image in the group. In this paper, we address this problem using a new machine learning framework, Multi-Instance Multi-Label (MIML) learning. We first show that the underlying nature of the annotation task is a typical MIML learning problem. Then, we propose two support vector machine algorithms under the MIML framework for the task. Experimental results on the FlyExpress database (a digital library of standardized Drosophila gene expression pattern images) reveal that the exploitation of MIML framework leads to significant performance improvement over state-of-the-art approaches.", "article_number": "5753882", "pdf_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5753882", "html_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5753882/", "abstract_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5753882/", "publication_title": "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics", "publication_number": 8857, "is_number": 6078452, "publication_year": 2012, "publication_date": "Jan.-Feb. 2012", "start_page": "98", "end_page": "112", "citing_paper_count": 38, "citing_patent_count": 0, "index_terms": {"ieee_terms": {"terms": ["Gene expression", "Databases", "Embryo", "Machine learning", "Bioinformatics", "Head", "Computational biology"]}, "author_terms": {"terms": ["Gene expression pattern", "image annotation", "machine learning", "multi-instance multi-label (MIML) learning", "support vector machine", "Drosophila."]}}}, {"doi": "10.1109/IRI.2012.6303086", "title": "Dependance of critical dimension on learning machines and ranking methods", "publisher": "IEEE", "isbn": "978-1-4673-2283-6", "partnum": "12EX4806", "rank": 6, "authors": {"authors": [{"affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, Socorro, USA", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38234622600", "id": 38234622600, "full_name": "Divya Suryakumar", "author_order": 1}, {"affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, Socorro, USA", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284014600", "id": 37284014600, "full_name": "Andrew H.

Using e-Learning, a number of world ranking universities are starting different courses for high school level to degree level and even at post graduate level through distance learning. This paper describes the best-known different machine learning techniques to boost up the e-Learning education standard and model. Comprehensively supervised and unsupervised techniques are described here for the e-Learning paradigm to auto reply of students' questions. Web bot is incorporated for the learning of students who are taking courses by remote mode. Due to the number of students enrolled in a particular course, student teacher interaction is a major challenge. Thus the solution is to train the Web based bot and make it available for the students' interaction 24/7. Main drawback of e-Learning environment is not frequent replies of student queries which we are going to cover by using web bot. The key demand is to deal with learning techniques but not fully automated. Training of the machine is performed on training data and validation is performed on test data set.

In this paper we use a batch mode incremental and active learning framework to construct scene classification models. In traditional batch examples selection methods, there often exists redundancy information between these top informative examples. To alleviate the impact of redundancy, we employ two effective batch selection strategies which one is called multi-pool based BvSB and the other is called K-centroid cluster BvSB, experimental results with widely used 15 scene and UIUC-sports datasets demonstrated that our scheme can get better results than that only using BvSB measurement which does not considering redundancy.

This is due to the many new applications that have been taken place in the field of Internet traffic. As conventional port number based and packet payload based methods are no longer adequate, pattern recognition by learning the statistical flow-based features in the training samples to classify the unknown flows has become popular. The applied method should be fast enough to identify the traffic type in real time before the entire flows are finished. This paper proposes a supervised machine learning based method to identify 7 different types of Internet applications. Our proposed system is able to detect the flows application types after observing just a few first packets in each flow in order to run in real time. The overall accuracy of 84.9% was achieved which is a promising result.", "article_number": "6335034", "pdf_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6335034", "html_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6335034/", "abstract_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6335034/", "publication_title": "2012 25th IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)", "conference_location": "Montreal, QC, Canada", "conference_dates": "29 April-2 May 2012", "publication_number": 6329166, "is_number": 6334811, "publication_year": 2012, "publication_date": "29 April-2 May 2012", "start_page": "1", "end_page": "5", "citing_paper_count": 8, "citing_patent_count": 0, "index_terms": {"ieee_terms": {"terms": ["Internet", "Support vector machines", "Protocols", "Payloads", "Accuracy", "Real-time systems", "Electronic mail"]}, "author_terms": {"terms": ["Internet traffic classification", "Pattern recognition", "SVMs", "Multi-class classification", "Maximum mutual information"]}}, "isbn_formats": {"isbns": [{"format": "Online ISBN", "value": "978-1-4673-1432-9", "isbnType": "New-2005"}, {"format": "Print ISBN", "value": "978-1-4673-1431-2", "isbnType": "New-2005"}, {"format": "Electronic ISBN", "value": "978-1-4673-1433-6", "isbnType": "New-2005"}]}}, {"doi": "10.1109/DevLrn.2012.6400890", "title": "Simultaneous motor and sensory learning for imitation", "publisher": "IEEE", "isbn": "978-1-4673-4963-5", "issn": "2161-9476", "partnum": "12EX7757", "rank": 24, "authors": {"authors": [{"affiliation": "Machine Perception Lab, UC San Diego, USA", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37534601600", "id": 37534601600, "full_name": "Tingfan Wu", "author_order": 1}, {"affiliation": "Machine Perception Lab, UC San Diego, USA", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37296039500", "id": 37296039500, "full_name": "Javier Movellan", "author_order": 2}]}, "access_type": "LOCKED", "content_type": "Conferences", "abstract": "One important capability for future robots to go beyond factory assembly line into human daily life is to be able to acquire new motor skill autonomously from na\u00efve human teachers. Recently, many new imitation learning algorithms were proposed with promising results, such as throwing a ball into a basket[1], jiggling ping-pong balls on a racket[2], and moving a tendon driven hand to tap a switch[3]. These robots typically start from blindly copying demonstrator's trajectory and then iteratively improve the trajectory with respect to certain predefined \u201cgoodness\u201d function. We call it \u201cscoring function.\u201d Most of these tasks are spatial movements and thus the scoring function can be heuristically defined based on the end-effector position or system state. However, in many real life tasks, the outcome of an action is more important rather than the movement trajectory itself. A proper measurable scoring function that evaluates the \u201cgoodness\u201d of the outcome is thus necessary. In this work, we consider the case where the scoring function is a not a trivial spatial mapping from robot movement to a scalar. For example, the softness of the sounds of a violin played by a robot with certain contact force and velocity of the bow. Another example is the happiness of a robotic face given the amount of facial servo movement. In this case, the non-trivial cost function needs to be learned either from human demonstrations prior to motor learning or from robot's own exploration during motor learning with feedback from a teacher. In particular, we develop the following learning framework as in Fig. 1. In the proposed framework, both the scoring function as well as the motor policy are learned at the same time. However, the two learning systems do not have to be fully synchronized. For example, the human teacher may decide to give the robot feedback only on some of the executions and let the robot explore by itself most of the time.", "article_number": "6400890", "pdf_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400890", "html_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400890/", "abstract_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400890/", "publication_title": "2012 IEEE International Conference on Development and Learning and Epigenetic Robotics (ICDL)", "conference_location": "San Diego, CA, USA", "conference_dates": "7-9 Nov. 2012", "publication_number": 6384412, "is_number": 6400572, "publication_year": 2012, "publication_date": "7-9 Nov. 2012", "start_page": "1", "end_page": "2", "citing_paper_count": 0, "citing_patent_count": 0, "index_terms": {"ieee_terms": {"terms": ["Robot sensing systems", "Learning systems", "Humans", "Trajectory", "Force", "Machine learning"]}}, "isbn_formats": {"isbns": [{"format": "Online ISBN", "value": "978-1-4673-4963-5", "isbnType": "New-2005"}, {"format": "Print ISBN", "value": "978-1-4673-4964-2", "isbnType": "New-2005"}, {"format": "Electronic ISBN", "value": "978-1-4673-4965-9", "isbnType": "New-2005"}]}}, {"doi": "10.1109/ICCSEE.2012.1", "title": "A Decision-Making Method Using Knowledge-Based Machine Learning", "publisher": "IEEE", "isbn": "978-1-4673-0689-8", "partnum": "12PR4647", "rank": 25, "volume": "3", "authors": {"authors": [{"affiliation": "Software Inst., Zhongshan Univ., Guangzhou, China", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593082400", "id": 37593082400, "full_name": "Qing Zhou", "author_order": 1}, {"affiliation": "Inf.
