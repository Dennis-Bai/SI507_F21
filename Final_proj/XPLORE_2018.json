The focus of this new advancement is the patient data collected from patient Electronic health records (EHR), Internet of Things (IoT) sensor devices, wearables and mobile devices, web-based information and social media. PH applies Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to the collected dataset to improve disease progression technique, disease prediction, patient selfmanagement and clinical intervention. Machine learning techniques are widely used in this regard to develop analytic models. These models are integrated into different healthcare service applications and clinical decision support systems. These models mainly analyse the collected data from sensor devices and other sources to identify behavioral patterns and clinical conditions of the patient. For example, these models analyse the collected data to identify the patient's improvements, habits and anomaly in daily routine, changes in sleeping and mobility, eating, drinking and digestive pattern. Based on those patterns the healthcare applications and the clinical decision support systems recommend lifestyle advice, special treatment and care plans for the patient. The doctors and caregivers can also be engaged in the care plan process to validate lifestyle advice. However, there are many uncertainties and a grey area when it comes to applying machine learning in this context. Clinical, behaviour and lifestyle data in nature are very sensitive. There could be different types of biased involved in the process of data collection and interpretation. The training data model could have an older version of the dataset. All these could lead to an incorrect decision from the system without the user's knowledge.

To validate the performances of these models, two trust computation measures were used: Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROCs), Precision and Recall. The malicious data was formulated in Matlab.

However, very few works have been done on Bangla text for social media activity monitoring due to a lack of a large number of annotated corpora, named dictionaries and morphological analyzer, which demands in-depth analysis on Bangladesh's perspective. Moreover, solving the issue by applying available techniques is very content specific, which means that false detection can occur if contents changed from formal English to verbal abuse or sarcasm. Also, performance may vary due to linguistic differences between English and non-English contents and the socio-emotional behaviour of the study population. To combat such issues, this paper proposes the use of machine learning algorithms and the inclusion of user information for cyber bullying detection on Bangla text. For this purpose, a set of Bangla text has been collected from available social media platforms and labelled as either bullied or not bullied for training different machine learning based classification models. Cross-validation results of the models indicate that a support vector machine based algorithm achieves superior performance on Bangla text with a detection accuracy of 97%. Besides, the impact of user specific information such as location, age and gender can further improve the classification accuracy of Bangla cyber bullying detection system.", "article_number": "8636797", "pdf_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8636797", "html_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8636797/", "abstract_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8636797/", "publication_title": "2018 10th International Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (ICECE)", "conference_location": "Dhaka, Bangladesh", "conference_dates": "20-22 Dec. 2018", "publication_number": 8622655, "is_number": 8636685, "publication_year": 2018, "publication_date": "20-22 Dec. 2018", "start_page": "385", "end_page": "388", "citing_paper_count": 5, "citing_patent_count": 0, "index_terms": {"ieee_terms": {"terms": ["Social networking (online)", "Support vector machines", "Text categorization", "Machine learning", "Classification algorithms", "Machine learning algorithms", "Feature extraction"]}, "author_terms": {"terms": ["Cyber bullying", "Bangla text", "Classification", "Machine learning"]}}, "isbn_formats": {"isbns": [{"format": "Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN", "value": "978-1-5386-7483-3", "isbnType": "New-2005"}, {"format": "Electronic ISBN", "value": "978-1-5386-7482-6", "isbnType": "New-2005"}]}}, {"doi": "10.1109/IDAP.2018.8620767", "title": "Forecasting CO<inf>2</inf> Emission with Machine Learning Methods", "publisher": "IEEE", "isbn": "978-1-5386-6879-5", "rank": 17, "authors": {"authors": [{"affiliation": "M\u00fchendislik Y\u00f6netimi, Istanbul Medeniyet \u00dcniversitesi, Istanbul, T\u00fcrkiye", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086601942", "id": 37086601942, "full_name": "Evin GAR\u0130P", "author_order": 1}, {"affiliation": "Bilgisayar M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, Istanbul Medeniyet \u00dcniversitesi, Istanbul, T\u00fcrkiye", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37657897000", "id": 37657897000, "full_name": "Ayse Betul OKTAY", "author_order": 2}]}, "access_type": "LOCKED", "content_type": "Conferences", "abstract": "The amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emission has significantly increased because of the increase in industrial production, usage of fossil fuels such as petroleum and coal which is a danger for global warming.

Monitoring microservices deployed in a Kubernetes orchestrated distributed advanced analytics machine learning engines is at the heart of many cloud resource management solutions. In addition, measuring resource utilization at more granular level such as per query or sub-query basis in an MPP Machine Learning Engine (MLE) is key to resource planning and is also the focus of our work. In this paper we propose two mechanisms to measure resource utilization in Teradata Machine Learning Engine (MLE). First mechanism is the Cluster Resource Monitoring (CRM). CRM is a high-level resource measuring mechanism for IT administrators and analytics users to visualize, plot, generates alerts and perform live and historical-analytics on overall cluster usage statistics. Second mechanism is the Query Resource Monitoring (QRM). QRM enables IT administrators and MLE users to measure compute resource utilization per individual query and its sub-queries. When query takes long time, QRM provides insights. This is useful to identify expensive phases within a query that tax certain resources more and skew the work distribution. We show the results of proposed mechanisms and highlight use-cases.", "article_number": "8614791", "pdf_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8614791", "html_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8614791/", "abstract_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8614791/", "publication_title": "2018 IEEE 9th Annual Information Technology, Electronics and Mobile Communication Conference (IEMCON)", "conference_location": "Vancouver, BC, Canada", "conference_dates": "1-3 Nov. 2018", "publication_number": 8584037, "is_number": 8614741, "publication_year": 2018, "publication_date": "1-3 Nov. 2018", "start_page": "486", "end_page": "492", "citing_paper_count": 0, "citing_patent_count": 0, "index_terms": {"ieee_terms": {"terms": ["Monitoring", "Resource management", "Engines", "Containers", "Machine learning", "Maximum likelihood estimation", "Customer relationship management"]}, "author_terms": {"terms": ["Big Data", "Data Analytics", "Machine Learning", "Docker", "Linux Containers (LXC)", "Massively Parallel Processing (MPP)", "MapReduce", "Kubernetes", "Monitoring", "and Workload Skew"]}}, "isbn_formats": {"isbns": [{"format": "Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN", "value": "978-1-5386-7267-9", "isbnType": "New-2005"}, {"format": "USB ISBN", "value": "978-1-5386-7265-5", "isbnType": "New-2005"}, {"format": "Electronic ISBN", "value": "978-1-5386-7266-2", "isbnType": "New-2005"}]}}]}
