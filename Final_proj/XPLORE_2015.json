Many algorithms for feature learning depend on cross-validation or empirical methods to optimize the number of features. In this work, we propose an learning algorithm to find the optimal model complexity for the RBMs by incrementing the hidden layer. The proposed algorithm is composed of two processes: 1) determining incrementation necessity of neurons and 2) computing the number of additional features for the increment. Specifically, the proposed algorithm uses a normalized reconstruction error in order to determine incrementation necessity and prevent unnecessary increment for the number of features during training. Our experimental results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm converges to the optimal number of features in a single layer RBMs. In the classification results, our model could outperform the non-incremental RBM.", "article_number": "7338643", "pdf_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7338643", "html_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7338643/", "abstract_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7338643/", "publication_title": "2015 International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences (ICCAIS)", "conference_location": "Changshu, China", "conference_dates": "29-31 Oct. 2015", "publication_number": 7327977, "is_number": 7338636, "publication_year": 2015, "publication_date": "29-31 Oct. 2015", "start_page": "113", "end_page": "117", "citing_paper_count": 2, "citing_patent_count": 0, "index_terms": {"ieee_terms": {"terms": ["Neurons", "Complexity theory", "Computational modeling", "Training", "Error analysis", "Training data", "Standards"]}, "author_terms": {"terms": ["Machine learning", "incremental learning", "restricted boltzmann machine"]}}, "isbn_formats": {"isbns": [{"format": "USB ISBN", "value": "978-1-4799-9891-3", "isbnType": "New-2005"}, {"format": "Electronic ISBN", "value": "978-1-4799-9892-0", "isbnType": "New-2005"}]}}, {"doi": "10.1109/ICMLA.2015.24", "title": "Restricted Boltzmann Machine for Nonlinear System Modeling", "publisher": "IEEE", "isbn": "978-1-5090-0286-3", "rank": 2, "authors": {"authors": [{"affiliation": "Dept. de Control Automatico, CINVESTAV-IPN (Nat.

Although manual change detection is an option, the time required for it can be prohibitive. It is also highly subjective depending on the expertise of the analyst.

This paper analyzes the effectiveness of the three types of unsupervised Machine learning algorithms (MLAs) for change detection to detect the change in some of the dominant classes in an urban area, such as, vegetation, built-up and water bodies. Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI imageries have been selected for a part of New Delhi and its nearby area. In this study, three indices namely Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI<sub>2</sub>) have been generated from the Landsat data. Three algorithms, namely, K-Means, FCM and EM have been used, since these represent three different concepts in machine learning category i.e. partition based, fuzzy and probability based respectively.

To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work that employs a bioinspired spike-based learning algorithm for the LSM. With the proposed online learning, the LSM extracts information from input patterns on the fly without needing intermediate data storage as required in offline learning methods such as ridge regression. The proposed learning rule is local such that each synaptic weight update is based only upon the firing activities of the corresponding presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons without incurring global communications across the neural network. Compared with the backpropagation-based learning, the locality of computation in the proposed approach lends itself to efficient parallel VLSI implementation. We use subsets of the TI46 speech corpus to benchmark the bioinspired digital LSM. To reduce the complexity of the spiking neural network model without performance degradation for speech recognition, we study the impacts of synaptic models on the fading memory of the reservoir and hence the network performance. Moreover, we examine the tradeoffs between synaptic weight resolution, reservoir size, and recognition performance and present techniques to further reduce the overhead of hardware implementation. Our simulation results show that in terms of isolated word recognition evaluated using the TI46 speech corpus, the proposed digital LSM rivals the state-of-the-art hidden Markov-model-based recognizer Sphinx-4 and outperforms all other reported recognizers including the ones that are based upon the LSM or neural networks.", "article_number": "7024132", "pdf_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7024132", "html_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7024132/", "abstract_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7024132/", "publication_title": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems", "publication_number": 5962385, "is_number": 7299729, "publication_year": 2015, "publication_date": "Nov. 2015", "start_page": "2635", "end_page": "2649", "citing_paper_count": 80, "citing_patent_count": 1, "index_terms": {"ieee_terms": {"terms": ["Neurons", "Speech recognition", "Reservoirs", "Biological neural networks", "Hidden Markov models", "Speech"]}, "author_terms": {"terms": ["Hardware implementation", "liquid-state machine (LSM)", "speech recognition", "spike-based learning.", "Hardware implementation", "liquid-state machine (LSM)", "speech recognition", "spike-based learning"]}}}, {"doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2015.7340664", "title": "The failure analysis of extreme learning machine on big data and the counter measure", "publisher": "IEEE", "isbn": "978-1-4673-7220-6", "rank": 10, "volume": "2", "authors": {"authors": [{"affiliation": "College of Mathematics and Information Science, Hebei University, Baoding 071002, China", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085609932", "id": 37085609932, "full_name": "Pm-Zhou Zhang", "author_order": 1}, {"affiliation": "College of Management, Hebei University, Baoding 071002, China", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085627756", "id": 37085627756, "full_name": "Shi-Xin Zhao", "author_order": 2}, {"affiliation": "College of Mathematics and Information Science, Hebei University, Baoding 071002, China", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085631087", "id": 37085631087, "full_name": "Xi-Zhao Wang", "author_order": 3}]}, "access_type": "LOCKED", "content_type": "Conferences", "abstract": "Extreme learning machine (ELM) for single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs) was known for its extremely fast learning speed while maintaining acceptable generalization.

HCCI engine operation is constrained by combustion instabilities, such as knock, ringing, misfires, high-variability combustion, and so on, and it becomes important to identify the operating envelope defined by these constraints for use in engine diagnostics and controller design. HCCI combustion is dominated by complex nonlinear dynamics, and a first-principle-based dynamic modeling of the operating envelope becomes intractable. In this paper, a machine learning approach is presented to identify the stable operating envelope of HCCI combustion, by learning directly from the experimental data. Stability is defined using thresholds on combustion features obtained from engine in-cylinder pressure measurements. This paper considers instabilities arising from engine misfire and high-variability combustion. A gasoline HCCI engine is used for generating stable and unstable data observations. Owing to an imbalance in class proportions in the data set, the models are developed both based on resampling the data set (by undersampling and oversampling) and based on a cost-sensitive learning method (by overweighting the minority class relative to the majority class observations). Support vector machines (SVMs) and recently developed extreme learning machines (ELM) are utilized for developing dynamic classifiers. The results compared against linear classification methods show that cost-sensitive nonlinear ELM and SVM classification algorithms are well suited for the problem. However, the SVM envelope model requires about 80% more parameters for an accuracy improvement of 3% compared with the ELM envelope model indicating that ELM models may be computationally suitable for the engine application. The proposed modeling approach shows that HCCI engine misfires and high-variability combustion can be predicted ahead of time, given the present values of available sensor measurements, making the models suitable for engine diagnostics and control applications.", "article_number": "6781632", "pdf_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6781632", "html_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6781632/", "abstract_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6781632/", "publication_title": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems", "publication_number": 5962385, "is_number": 6990695, "publication_year": 2015, "publication_date": "Jan. 2015", "start_page": "98", "end_page": "112", "citing_paper_count": 27, "citing_patent_count": 0, "index_terms": {"ieee_terms": {"terms": ["Combustion", "Internal combustion engines", "Predictive models", "Data models", "Support vector machines", "Fuels"]}, "author_terms": {"terms": ["Class imbalance learning", "dynamic classification", "engine control", "engine diagnostics", "extreme learning machine", "homogeneous charge compression ignition", "misfire prediction", "operating envelope model", "support vector machine", "system identification.", "Class imbalance learning", "dynamic classification", "engine control", "engine diagnostics", "extreme learning machine", "homogeneous charge compression ignition", "misfire prediction", "operating envelope model", "support vector machine", "system identification"]}}}, {"doi": "10.1109/MLSP.2015.7324345", "title": "Securing virtual execution environments through machine learning-based intrusion detection", "publisher": "IEEE", "isbn": "978-1-4673-7454-5", "issn": "2378-928X", "rank": 13, "authors": {"authors": [{"affiliation": "Northeastern University, ECE Department, Boston, MA, USA", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37857010000", "id": 37857010000, "full_name": "Fatemeh Azmandian", "author_order": 1}, {"affiliation": "Northeastern University, ECE Department, Boston, MA, USA", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37271686900", "id": 37271686900, "full_name": "David R.

The experiment on NSL-KDD data shows that the proposed approach outperforms ELM multiclass classifier, decision tree, neural network (NN) and support vector machines (SVM).", "article_number": "7279549", "pdf_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7279549", "html_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7279549/", "abstract_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7279549/", "publication_title": "2015 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation", "conference_location": "Lijiang, China", "conference_dates": "8-10 Aug. 2015", "publication_number": 7267673, "is_number": 7279248, "publication_year": 2015, "publication_date": "8-10 Aug. 2015", "start_page": "1642", "end_page": "1647", "citing_paper_count": 2, "citing_patent_count": 0, "index_terms": {"ieee_terms": {"terms": ["Training", "Support vector machines", "Decision trees", "Artificial neural networks", "Biological neural networks", "Machine learning algorithms", "Accuracy"]}, "author_terms": {"terms": ["Network Intrusion Classification", "Extreme Learning Machine", "NSL-KDD"]}}, "isbn_formats": {"isbns": [{"format": "USB ISBN", "value": "978-1-4673-9103-0", "isbnType": "New-2005"}, {"format": "Electronic ISBN", "value": "978-1-4673-9104-7", "isbnType": "New-2005"}]}}, {"doi": "10.1109/ICBME.2015.7404123", "title": "Machine learning-based signal processing using physiological signals for stress detection", "publisher": "IEEE", "isbn": "978-1-4673-9350-8", "rank": 17, "authors": {"authors": [{"affiliation": "Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085694274", "id": 37085694274, "full_name": "Adnan Ghaderi", "author_order": 1}, {"affiliation": "Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37426097800", "id": 37426097800, "full_name": "Javad Frounchi", "author_order": 2}, {"affiliation": "Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085696043", "id": 37085696043, "full_name": "Alireza Farnam", "author_order": 3}]}, "access_type": "LOCKED", "content_type": "Conferences", "abstract": "Stress is a common part of daily life which most people struggle in different occasions.

Simultaneous and proportional control of multiple DoFs is possible with regression-based approaches allowing for fluent and natural movements. Conventionally, the regressor is calibrated in an open-loop with training based on recorded data and the performance is evaluated subsequently. For individuals with amputation or congenital limb-deficiency who need to (re)learn how to generate suitable muscle contractions, this open-loop process may not be effective. We present a closed-loop real-time learning scheme in which both the user and the machine learn simultaneously to follow a common target. Experiments with ten able-bodied individuals show that this co-adaptive closed-loop learning strategy leads to significant performance improvements compared to a conventional open-loop training paradigm. Importantly, co-adaptive learning allowed two individuals with congenital deficiencies to perform simultaneous 2-D proportional control at levels comparable to the able-bodied individuals, despite having to a learn completely new and unfamiliar mapping from muscle activity to movement trajectories.

How to effectively incorporate new annotated data into the learning step is crucial for enhancing the performance of a bioinformatics prediction model. Although machine-learning-based methods have been extensively used for dealing with various biological problems, existing approaches usually train static prediction models based on fixed training datasets. The static approaches are found having several disadvantages such as low scalability and impractical when training dataset is huge. In view of this, we propose a dynamic learning framework for constructing query-driven prediction models. The key difference between the proposed framework and the existing approaches is that the training set for the machine learning algorithm of the proposed framework is dynamically generated according to the query input, as opposed to training a general model regardless of queries in traditional static methods. Accordingly, a query-driven predictor based on the smaller set of data specifically selected from the entire annotated base dataset will be applied on the query. The new way for constructing the dynamic model enables us capable of updating the annotated base dataset flexibly and using the most relevant core subset as the training set makes the constructed model having better generalization ability on the query, showing \u201cpart could be better than all\u201d phenomenon. According to the new framework, we have implemented a dynamic protein-ligand binding sites predictor called OSML (On-site model for ligand binding sites prediction). Computer experiments on 10 different ligand types of three hierarchically organized levels show that OSML outperforms most existing predictors. The results indicate that the current dynamic framework is a promising future direction for bridging the gap between the rapidly accumulated annotated biological data and the effective machine-learning-based predictors.

A novel SOC estimation algorithm based on extreme learning machine (ELM) is proposed. Compared with the traditional neural network method, the ELM simplifies the computation procedure and shortens the learning time. A typical model of ELM is built for an 180Ah/3.2V lithium iron phosphate battery, and data acquired from cell discharge experiments under a series of current are contributed to model training and predicting. To evaluate the effect of ELM on SOC estimation, the back propagation (BP) neural network and the support vector machine (SVM) are taken into comparison. The results show that the ELM method provides a more accurate SOC. What is more important is that the speed of network training is improved greatly.", "article_number": "7398906", "pdf_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7398906", "html_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7398906/", "abstract_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7398906/", "publication_title": "2015 6th International Conference on Power Electronics Systems and Applications (PESA)", "conference_location": "Hong Kong", "conference_dates": "15-17 Dec. 2015", "publication_number": 7393091, "is_number": 7398881, "publication_year": 2015, "publication_date": "15-17 Dec. 2015", "start_page": "1", "end_page": "5", "citing_paper_count": 1, "citing_patent_count": 0, "index_terms": {"ieee_terms": {"terms": ["Estimation", "MATLAB", "Training", "Testing", "Support vector machines", "Biographies"]}, "author_terms": {"terms": ["Extreme learning machine", "lithium iron phosphate battery", "neural network", "State-of-charge (SOC) estimation"]}}, "isbn_formats": {"isbns": [{"format": "CD", "value": "978-1-5090-0061-6", "isbnType": "New-2005"}, {"format": "Print ISBN", "value": "978-1-5090-0062-3", "isbnType": "New-2005"}, {"format": "Electronic ISBN", "value": "978-1-5090-0063-0", "isbnType": "New-2005"}]}}, {"doi": "10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326122", "title": "Comparison of machine learning algotithms for leaf area index retrieval from time series MODIS data", "publisher": "IEEE", "isbn": "978-1-4799-7928-8", "issn": "2153-7003", "rank": 25, "authors": {"authors": [{"affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science, School of Geography, Beijing Normal University.

However, most of the methods used to retrieve LAI just use a single phase satellite observational data to estimate LAI. Because of the impact of clouds and aerosols, the LAI products generated by these methods are temporally discontinuous. In this study, performance of three machine learning algorithms for parameter estimation using time series data is evaluated. The three machine learning algorithms are back-propagation neutral network (BPNN), general regression neutral networks (GRNNs) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). The results show that these machine learning algorithms have a good performance in time series LAI retrieval and GRNNs outperform the other algorithms.", "article_number": "7326122", "pdf_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7326122", "html_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7326122/", "abstract_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7326122/", "publication_title": "2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)", "conference_location": "Milan, Italy", "conference_dates": "26-31 July 2015", "publication_number": 7303999, "is_number": 7325670, "publication_year": 2015, "publication_date": "26-31 July 2015", "start_page": "1729", "end_page": "1732", "citing_paper_count": 0, "citing_patent_count": 0, "index_terms": {"ieee_terms": {"terms": ["Machine learning algorithms", "MODIS", "Time series analysis", "Mars", "Reflectivity", "Training", "Indexes"]}, "author_terms": {"terms": ["Machine learning", "leaf area index", "time series", "comparison", "MODIS"]}}, "isbn_formats": {"isbns": [{"format": "USB ISBN", "value": "978-1-4799-7928-8", "isbnType": "New-2005"}, {"format": "Electronic ISBN", "value": "978-1-4799-7929-5", "isbnType": "New-2005"}]}}]}
